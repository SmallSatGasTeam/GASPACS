This file sets up the interrupt process. Every five seconds, the buffer of the serial port at /dev/serial0 is read.
Content is split up into AX.25 Packets, and Command Packets. The data is passed to Jack's packetProcessing.py methods.
TODO: Implement AX.25 digipeating, probably in packetProcessing.py
To defray the possibility of half a packet being in the buffer, any half-packets are stored and evaluated the next time around
